# Advanced Database Project

This is a humble little presentation I created during my university course on Advanced Databases. The project idea revolves around designing a database system for a Library, covering its main entities, relationships, and operations.

ðŸ“š It was part of our course project and aims to demonstrate practical application of database design concepts â€” in a simple and creative way.

 It may not be a massive project, but itâ€™s a small step in my learning journey!âœ¨
